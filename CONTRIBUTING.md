# CONTRIBUTING

We use the MPL 2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)) for our software to strike a balance between reciprocity and reach. It ensures that any modifications to our source code are shared with the community, upholding our principles of transparency and sovereignty.

At the same time, its “weak copyleft” nature prevents the legal hurdles often associated with stricter licenses, making it business-friendly and ensuring that uFabric’s research can be integrated into diverse environments to enhance human capabilities responsibly.

By contributing, you agree that uFabric remains the owner of the project's licensing strategy and may update it for future versions.
