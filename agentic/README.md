# Agentic

This directory contains agent-facing documentation for AI agents working alongside humans.

## Entry point

If you give an LLM/agent one file from this repository, start with:

- `agentic/AGENT.md`

## What’s in here

- `agentic/AGENT.md`: single-file runbook (how to work in this repo and follow its rules).
- `agentic/REPO_MAP.md`: repository navigation map.
- `agentic/RULES.md`: short rules index derived from human docs (with citations).
- `agentic/SOURCES.md`: human sources of truth and “last verified” revision.
- `agentic/MAINTENANCE.md`: how to detect doc changes and refresh `agentic/`.
- `agentic/sources.lock.json`: machine-readable source list + revisions for change detection.

## Source of truth

All files in `agentic/` are derived artifacts. Human-maintained documentation under `docs/` and root project policies are the source of truth.
